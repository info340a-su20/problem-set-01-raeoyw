            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elsa_(Frozen)">Elsa</a> 
            of Arendelle is a fictional character who appears in Walt Disney 
            Animation Studios' 53rd animated film Frozen and its sequel Frozen II.
            She is introduced as a princess in the fictional Scandinavian Kingdom 
            of Arendelle, heiress to the throne and the elder sister of Princess 
            Anna. Elsa has the magical ability to create and manipulate ice and 
            snow. She inadvertently sends Arendelle into an eternal winter on the 
            evening of her coronation. Throughout the film, she struggles first 
            with controlling and concealing her abilities and then with liberating 
            herself from her fears of unintentionally harming others, especially 
            her younger sister.
